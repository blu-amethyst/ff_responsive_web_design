          <code>Luo Hon Zhai</code> is a traditional vegetarian dish well known in Chinese and Buddhist cuisine. It is commonly known in English as <code>Buddha's Delight</code>.</p>
          <p>Throughout decades, foodies have been creating various variance by adding and modifying part of the recipe. And for this post, I am sharing one of my favorite variance.</p>

        <p>Please be aware, this is one of the many dish to share among people. </p>

          <h2>The Story</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The name comes from Chinese Buddhism. Luóhàn is a Chinese transliteration of the Sanskrit word arhat, meaning an enlightened individual or saint. Zhai means "vegetarian food" or "vegetarian diet." Thus, it translates to "Vegetarian Dish of the Arhats (Saints)</p>
        <p>It is a stir-fried or braised medley of various vegetables, fungi, and vegetarian protein sources a.k.a <code>red beancurd paste (Nam Yu)</code>. It is famously made with many ingredients—traditionally at least 10, though more elaborate versions can feature 18 (representing the 18 Arhats) or more.</p>
    <p>It is traditionally enjoyed by Buddhist monks and is a popular dish served in Chinese households on the first day of the <code>Chinese New Year</code> as a form of self-purification, following the belief that one should maintain a vegetarian diet at the start of the year.

          <h2>Instruction</h2>
        </header>
        <p>This is a tedious dish! You need at least <code>5 hours to prepare in advanced before cooking.</code></p>

        <hr>
          <p>And now let's cook! I am going to separate into 2 parters. One before the sauce, then after sauce.</p>
          <h3>Cook before sauce</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Add oil enough to cover the pan/ wok</li>
            <li>Put garlic, dried oyster and shrimp, mushroom into the pan. Stir Fry for around 2-3 minutes, until color change. (* You don't need to ensure its entirety cooked, as we are going to cook in part 2.)</li>
            <li>Pour in the water that used to soak oyster and mushroom to deglaze the pan. Wait for approx. 1-2min.</li>
            <li>Pour the content into a big bowl and set it aside.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Cook with Sauce</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Put the Red Beancurd paste into the pan, mashed it with the oil. (It normally comes in cube)</li>
            <li>Put 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce and 1.5 tablespoon of sugar in and stir.</li>
            <li>Pour in assortment seafood and stir fry for a little while.</li>
            <li>Put the cooked content in along with the water and stir fry for a bit.</li>
            <li>Put the rest of the ingredients in and stir fry for 2 min </li>
            <li>Add water in, enough to cover the suface. Put approximate stock cube in. (If you are using liquid stock, the latter step can be omitted).</li>
            <li>Put on medium heat until it boil, maintain for 10 minutes. (DO NOT BURNT THE POT)</li>
            <li>Switch to low heat to continue to cook for 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li>Taste the sauce. If too salty, put sugar in to balance out.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Pair-With</h2>
        </header>
        <p>In Chinese cuisine, it's pretty normal to have few dishes to share among friends and families. You can pair this dish with the below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Plain Rice (MUST)</li>
          <li>Mock Fried Geese - Vegetarian (Highly Recommend, but not every brand is delicious. Can be found in some frozen aisle)<img src="https://theplantbasedwok.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/vegetarian-roast-goose-6153-scaled.jpg"></li>
          <li>Carrot and Corn Soup (Balance out the heavy taste from Buddha Delight)<img src="https://www.philips.com.hk/c-dam/b2c/kitchen/hong-kong/porkbonebrothwithchayotecarrotandcorn.jpg"></li>
          <li>Cold Jasmine Chinese Tea</li>
